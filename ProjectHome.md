The Vital Sign Ontology (VSO) is an extension of the Ontology for General Medical Science (OGMS). VSO covers the four consensus human vital signs:
  * blood pressure
  * body temperature
  * respiration rate
  * pulse rate

It provides also a controlled structured vocabulary for describing vital signs measurement data, the various processes of measuring vital signs, and the various devices and anatomical entities participating in such measurements.

The preliminary design of VSO is described in a <a href='http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/Vital_Sign_Ontology.pdf'>Bio-Ontologies 2011 SIG paper</a>. VSO is expected to undergo some change with the release of BFO 2.0, particularly, the treatment of rates.

In addition to all of the OBO Foundry best practices, the VSO will adhere to these principles:

  * Any questions of "What is a sign?" will be left to OGMS to decide
  * Any questions of "Is 'vital sign' a universal?" will be left to OGMS to decide
  * No fifth vital sign will be added until it achieves broad clinical acceptance AND consensus for addition to VSO
  * VSO will not include complex terms such as 'post-medication nighttime resting blood pressure' as primitives, but will instead build these from simpler terms in the OBO Foundry
